# Key Points
## Fundamental Programming Structures

* In Java, all methods are declared in a class. You invoke a non-static method on an object of the class to which the method belongs. 
* Static methods are not invoked on objects. Program execution starts with the static `main` method. 
* Java has eight primitive types: four signed integral types, two floating-point types, `char`, and `boolean`. 
* The Java operators and control structures are very similar to those of C or JavaScript. 
* There are four forms of `switch`: expressions and statements with and without fall-through. 
* The `Math` class provides common mathematical functions. 
* `String` objects are sequences of characters or, more precisely, Unicode code points in the UTF-16 encoding.
* Use the **“text box”** syntax to declare multiline string literals. 
* With the `System.out` object, you can display output in a terminal window. A `Scanner` tied to `System.in` lets you read terminal input. 
* Arrays and collections can be used to collect elements of the same type.
